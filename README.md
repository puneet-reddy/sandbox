# sandbox
Just a place to dump all my experiments, tutorials and random stuff.

1. Projects - 
Contains full fledged implementations which are useful in and of themselves. Some may be work in progress.
2. Expeiments - 
All my random trials, scratch-book type learning and throwaway code. There's usually quite a few interesting snippets of things here though. Good for ideas.
3. Snippets -
Things I've written or found which are amenable to re-use
